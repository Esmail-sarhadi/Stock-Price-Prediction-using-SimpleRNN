# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-SimpleRNN
This project implements a stock price prediction model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in Python. The model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future prices. The key steps include data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of predictions.
